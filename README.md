#How To Use
Save the code in a file with a .py extension, such as virus.py.

Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the virus.py file is located using the cd command.

Execute the program by running the following command:
python virus.py program1 program2 ... -n <num_programs> -d <delay_seconds> -r

Replace program1, program2, and so on with the names of the programs you want to open repeatedly. For example, you can use notepad, calc, paint, or chrome.
#functionalities on program1 program2 ... -n <num_programs> -d <delay_seconds> -r
-n <num_programs> specifies the number of times to open the programs. Replace <num_programs> with the desired number.
-d <delay_seconds> sets the delay in seconds between program launches. Replace <delay_seconds> with the desired delay value.
-r enables random selection of programs. Include this option if you want the programs to be opened randomly.

This command will open the programs notepad, calc, paint, and chrome randomly 50 times, with a delay of 0.5 seconds between each launch.
Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system and the python command is recognized in the command prompt or terminal.
Please be aware that using this code to repeatedly open programs without the recipient's consent may be considered malicious. Make sure to use it responsibly and with permission.

#to close the program 
Close the programs manually: You can manually close the programs that are being opened. Use the taskbar or task manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc on Windows) to locate the program windows and close them one by one.

Terminate the Python script: If you launched the program from a command prompt or terminal, you can stop it by pressing Ctrl+C. This will interrupt the execution of the Python script and terminate it.

Forcefully terminate the Python script: If the script doesn't respond to Ctrl+C, you can forcefully terminate it. In Windows, you can use the task manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) to locate the Python process and end it. On Linux or macOS, you can use the kill command or the task manager equivalent to terminate the Python process.

Remember, it's important to use this code responsibly and only with appropriate consent and permissions. Misuse of such code can be considered malicious and may have legal consequences.
